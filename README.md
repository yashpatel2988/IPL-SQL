# IPL SQL Practice Repository

Welcome to the IPL SQL Practice Repository! üèè

This repository has been created for the sole purpose of honing my SQL skills. As an ardent cricket fan, I've chosen to dive into the vast world of the Indian Premier League (IPL) dataset. My aim is to explore, analyze, and learn SQL through meaningful questions and inquiries that reflect my cricketing curiosity.

## About this Repository

In my quest to master SQL, I have meticulously examined the IPL dataset and crafted a set of intriguing questions. These questions are not just about SQL; they also reflect the burning queries of a cricket fan's heart. I've ensured that my SQL practice encompasses a wide range of topics, making it both comprehensive and meaningful.

While some questions may appear basic, they serve as building blocks for my SQL journey. Each query has been designed to add value to my cricketing knowledge while simultaneously strengthening my SQL skills.

## Ongoing Learning

Learning is a continuous journey, and this repository is no exception. I am committed to expanding my SQL knowledge, and as such, I will keep adding new questions and insights as I progress. So, stay tuned for updates and feel free to contribute your own questions and ideas!

Thank you for joining me on this exciting SQL adventure through the world of cricket. Let's hit some boundaries and uncover the hidden insights within the IPL dataset together! üèÜüìä
